React.memo: it is a higher order component that is used to prevent a functional component
from being re-rendered when it's props and state do not change

useCallback(): it returns the memorized version of the callback functio that only changes 
when one of the dependencies get changed

when to use useCallback?
    it is used when we are passing a callback fucntio to the optimized child components that 
    rely on the reference equality to prevent the un-necesary renders.
